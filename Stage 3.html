          A web page is text document written in a language called <b>HTML</b>, or <b>HyperText Markup Language</b>. People use browser to request data from servers via the Internet. The servers return the information back to the browser which interprets the data.

        Coding

      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          Coding happens when programmers write tex in a language that a computer can understand. We learned some simple coding using <b>HTML</b>, <b>Tags</b>, <b>Elements</b>, and <b>Attributes</b>.
          <br>
          <b>Tag</b> : A tag is always contained within angled brackets. Most tags have an opening tag (for example &lt; b &gt; and a closing tag &lt; /b &gt;).Some tags do not require a closing tag (like the &lt; br &gt;, line break tag).
          They are called <em>"void''</em> tags.
          <br>
          <b>Element</b>: An element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.
          <br>
          <b>Attribute</b>: An attribute is a property of an element, used to set the <em>href</em> attribute on an anchor tag. Used for making links, URL resources.
          <p>

          <p>
          Computers need to be told exactly what to do, using the correct "syntax". If you forget to close a &lt; b &gt; tag, <b> the computer will not be able to figure out what you had intended to make bold.
          It could be very frustrating and sometimes time consuming. Did I mention computers are stupid?</b>

            A computer requires programs to function. Per Wikipedia, A <b>computer program</b>, or just a <b>program</b>, is a sequence of instructions, written to perform a specified task with acomputer.
            Web browsers, word processors, spreadsheets, are all examples of a computer program.
            </p>
            <p>
            Python is an example of a programming language.  Because of its clear syntax and readability it allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C++ or Java.
            </p>
            <p>
            Programming languages were developed because computers need a set of specific instruction in order to run. In other languages, you might be able to convey your meaning using a few words and or incorrect sentences. Computers are dumb, they need to be told precisely, in a correct syntax, or grammar, what you want them to do.

            Python interpreter needs valid expression,  print 1 + 1 is a valid expression, but print 1 + (without a number at the end) is not.

          Lesson 2 - Variables & Strings
          </div>
          <div class="concept-description">
            <p>
            A variable in Python is a name that refers to a value stored in a memory location. You can store integers, decimals or characters in these variables.
            </p>
            <p>
            Python's usage of the "=" sign is not mathematical; it does <B>NOT</B> mean equality.
            </p>
            <p>
            A Python assignment statement forces the variable on the left hand side to become associated with the value of the expression on the right side. 
            For example: my_variable = 10, where as in a mathematical equation, 5 + 5 = 10 is an assertion that both sides of the equal sign are already, in fact, equal.
            </p>
            <p>
            The difference between 2 + 2 and "2" + "2" is the first entries are numbers and the ones in quotes are strings. The code 2 + 2 would give you 4, while "2" + "2" would provide and output of "22".
            </p>
            <p>Variables are useful because they minimize the amount of code and lessen repetition.

          Lesson 3 - Functions/'Procedures'
          </div>
          <div class="concept-description">
            A functions takes a value, or values, as its input, processes it and produces an output. 
            <B>def  my_fuction():</B> is an example of a function. It always starts with the word <b>def</B>, followed by any given function name, and then the function parameters in parentheses. These parameters will eventually be replaced by actual values when the function is used or called.
            To use a function, we write the name of the function followed by the value(s) we want to give it in parentheses.
            For example, a function named square might take a number as input and produce the square of that number as output.
            <b>def square (n):</b> (On next line) <B>return n * n</B>. 
            Functions help programmers avoid repetition by minimizing the amount of code. Once defined, it does not need to be defined again and can be reused over and over.
            A function needs the return keyword to tell Python what the function should produce as output.

            Lesson 4 - Control Loops
          </div>
          <div class="concept-description">
          For loops are traditionally used when you have a piece of code which you want to repeat n number of times. As an alternative, there is the While Loop. A While Loop repeatedly executes the body of the loop until the "test condition" is no longer true.
          Lists store data in a structured manner. Each element of a sequence is assigned a number - its position or index. The first index is zero, the second index is one, and so forth. Objects in a list are comma-separated values (items) between square brackets. Lists can have other lists inside them. ['a', 'b', ['c', 'd']]. Lists can contain different type of variables, i.e. strings, integers, characters. ['Python', 'Python is a Programming Language', '2',].
          Mutation - It means that we can change the value of a list after we have created it, but we cannot in case of strings. Strings can only hold a set of characters.
          Append - It's the command used to add elements to a list. list = ['a', 'b', 'c'].  list.append('d').
          New values are List = ['a', 'b', 'c','d']
          + - concatenates values in a list creating new list.  ['a', 'b',] + ['c','d'] = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd]
          When two identifiers refer to the same variable (and therefore value), this is known as an alias.
          Len = length of the elements in a list.

            Stage 3 - Introduction to Abstraction
          </div>
          <div class="concept-description">
          Python has a module inside its Standard Library called OS (Operating System). Inside are other functions, like listdir and rename. We can read the documentation to see what these functions do, even though we don't really understand how they work in the scenes. This is called Abstraction.
          Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a powerful way of writing programs. 'An object in programming is an entity or variable that has two entities attached to it: data and things that act on that data. The data are called attributes of the object, and the functions attached to the object that can act on the data are called methods of the object.'- Johnny Wei-Bing Lin
          For example: turtle.Turtle() (Turtle graphics is a popular way for introducing programming to kids. It was part of the original Logo programming language developed by Wally Feurzig and Seymour Papert in 1966.)
          Lower case 'turtle' is a module inside Python’s Standard Library. Upper case 'Turtle' is a Class of the object 'turtle'.
          Class is used like a template or a neatly packaged set of attributes that puts things really well. It allows us to write code very easily and minimizes repetition, which is helpful when programming large projects. (This is called Object Oriented Programming, or OOP).
          When the module turtle.Turtle() is called (it is almost like calling a function), turtle is defined inside the class Turtle and it creates space in memory for a new instance or a new object of the class Turtle. It can now access all of the rest of the methods predefined like, left, right, forward, backward, circle. These can be used to create graphics. 
          The same module can be called in another instance of turtle with a whole different set of attributes, i.e., it can draw a different shape and it can be a different color etc.. This is known as Instance or Object of the Class.
          A Class can be compared to a car, i.e. a car which has been predefined to have a body, four wheels, an engine, seats, and steering wheel. An Instance or Object of a car can be a body of a different color, a race car, or one with four doors. It still has the predefined attributes plus its own unique properties.

          </p>
           __init__ is called immediately after an instance of the class is created, known as the Constructor. The first argument of every class method, including __init__, is always a reference to the current instance of the class. By convention, this argument is always named self. 
          Instance Variables are defined inside a method (__init__) and they are local to that instance.
          Instance Method is a function that is defined inside a class and is associated with an instance.
